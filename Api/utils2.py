In a tweet, Hundeyin said that the Wikipedia page of Tinubu, who was inaugurated as Nigeria’s president on Monday, had been edited and a drug trafficking section in his entry merged with the nondescript “Allegations of corruption” header. Hundeyin, who has been a ferocious Tinubu critic, said that the editing was done by a super-editor at Wikipedia, “Morbidthoughts”.” “Hi @Wikipedia, your super-editor “Morbidthoughts” who has spent months vandalising my Wikipedia page, has also recently removed the drug trafficking section in Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s entry, and merged it with the nondescript “Allegations of corruption” header. “Kindly explain why,” the journalist tweeted.
